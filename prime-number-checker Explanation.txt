This HTML and JavaScript program creates a simple web page where users can enter a number and check whether it's a prime number. The page includes a heading, an input field to enter a number, and a button labeled "Check Number". When the button is clicked, the checkNumber() function is triggered. This function retrieves the value entered by the user using document.getElementById("num").value and tries to parse it as an integer. If a valid number is entered, it passes the number to the isPrime() function, which checks if the number is prime by testing whether it is divisible by any number between 2 and itself (excluding). If the number is prime, the message "Prime Number" is displayed in green; if not, "Not a Prime Number" is shown in blue. If the input is empty or invalid, the program displays "Enter a Number" in red. The result is shown by updating the content and color of the second <h1> element, which has the ID header1, using the innerHTML and style.color properties.
